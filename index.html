						I am a Mandarin and Spanish tutor and have been tutoring
						for over five years now. After completing my Masters in
						Business Administration with a major in Marketing, I
						cleared my advanced level examinations in Mandarin and
						became a qualified professional tutor in the language.
						Thereafter, I have had the experience of teaching
						Mandarin and Spanish to several students and employees
						at various corporations across the globe. After such an
						enriching experience, I have become well-adept at
						understanding the requirements of students and providing
						a tailor-made teaching experience based on their needs.
						With my perfect blend of business knowledge and language
						proficiency, I ensure that my students get the best
						learning experience.
